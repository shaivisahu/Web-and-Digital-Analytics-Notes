        <h2> CSS</h2>
        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a powerful language that plays a crucial role in web development. Let’s delve into the details:
        <ol>
            <li>
            <h3> What is css ?</h3>
              CSS<strong> (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong> is a powerful language that plays a crucial role in web development. Let’s delve into the details:
               <ul>
                <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
                <li> It is a style sheet language used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language (usually HTML).</li>
                <li>CSS provides an additional layer of control over how web pages and user interfaces appear.</li>
                 <li> By using CSS, you can:
                <ul>
                    <li>Control the color of text.</li>
                    <li> Define font styles.</li>
                    <li> Specify spacing between paragraphs.</li>
                    <li>  Set background images or colors.</li>
                    <li>Create responsive layouts for different devices and screen sizes.</li>
                    <li>Apply a variety of other visual effects.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3> how does CSS work ?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>CSS defines style rules that are interpreted by the browser and then applied to corresponding elements in your document.</li>
                <li>A style rule set consists of two main parts:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong> Selector :</strong> Targets specific HTML elements to apply styles.</li>
                        <li><strong> Declaration Block :</strong>Contains one or more declarations, each consisting of a property and its corresponding value.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2> Why use css ?</h2>
           <ul>
            <li><strong> Time- Saving :</strong>Write CSS once and reuse it across multiple HTML pages</li>
            <li><strong>Easy Maintance :</strong>Make global changes by updating the style, and all elements in all webpages will automatically reflect the change.</li>
            <li><strong> Search engine Optimization (SEO)</strong> Clean CSS code helps search engines understand content better.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Superior Styling: </strong>CSS offers a wider array of attributes than HTML, allowing you to create visually appealing web pages.
                <li><strong> Offline Browser:</strong>CSS can store web applications locally, enabling offline viewing.
                </li>

        <h2> History of CSS</h2>
        The history of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is intertwined with the development of the World Wide Web and the need for improved presentation and styling of web documents. Here is a brief overview of the key milestones in the history of CSS:
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Early Web Design (1990s):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In the early days of the web, HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) was primarily used for structuring documents, and the styling was embedded directly within the HTML code.</li>
                <li>This inline styling made it challenging to maintain consistency across multiple pages and devices.</li>
            </ul></li><strong>CSS Emerges (1994-1996):</strong>
            <li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The need for a separate styling language led to the development of CSS.</li>
                    <li>Håkon Wium Lie and Bert Bos proposed the idea of Cascading Style Sheets in October 1994. Lie worked at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research), where Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, also worked.</li>
                    <li>In 1996, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) released the first official CSS specification, CSS1. This marked the beginning of a standardized approach to styling web documents.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>CSS Level 2 (1998):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>CSS Level 2 (CSS2) was introduced to address limitations in the initial CSS specification.</li>
                    <li>CSS2 brought new features and improvements, including positioning, z-index, and support for media types.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Browser Wars and Inconsistent Implementations (Late 1990s - Early 2000s):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>During the "Browser Wars" between Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator, there were inconsistencies in the implementation of CSS. Web developers faced challenges in creating cross-browser-compatible stylesheets.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>CSS Zen Garden (2003):</strong>
            <li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The CSS Zen Garden project, launched by Dave Shea in 2003, demonstrated the power of CSS for design by showcasing different styles applied to the same HTML markup. This project highlighted the separation of content and presentation.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>CSS3 and Modules (2005 Onwards):</strong>
            <li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The development of CSS3 began, introducing modularization to allow for the release of individual modules independently.</li>
                    <li>Various modules, such as Selectors, Colors, and Backgrounds, provided new features and capabilities for web designers.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Responsive Web Design (2010s):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The growing use of smartphones and tablets led to the need for responsive web design. Media queries in CSS3 became crucial for adapting layouts to different screen sizes and devices.</li>
                    
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>CSS Grid and Flexbox (2010s):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>CSS Grid Layout and Flexbox, two layout models, were introduced to simplify the creation of complex and responsive page layouts. They provided more control over the positioning and alignment of elements.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Current State (2020s):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>CSS continues to evolve with ongoing updates and refinements.</li>
                    <li> Features like CSS Variables, Custom Properties, and new layout techniques contribute to more efficient and maintainable stylesheets.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>

                <ul>
                    <li>Mobile browsers on devices like iOS (Safari) and Android (various browsers) generally provide good CSS support, but there can be some differences.</li>
                </ul></li>
            </ol>
          </p>
